Assignment 3 – I have a string “This is a program experiment for fun in python .
Get me a how many times the character has been repeated.
I want to replace the repetitive characters suppose I replace it with next character j like i+1 = j i+2 = k
3 I ‘s and 3 p ‘s
Solution : 
input_str = input(" Enter the Sentence : ")
char_count = {}
for char in input_str:
    if char != " ":
        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0)+1
print(char_count)
In this version, we use the get() method to check if the current character is already in the char_count dictionary. If it is, we add 1 to its count, otherwise we add it to the dictionary with a count of 1. The get() method returns the value associated with the key if it exists, otherwise it returns the default value of 0 (which is added to 1 to get the initial count). This simplifies the code and makes it more concise.
2nd question –
 input_str = "This is a program experiment for fun in python"
char_count = {}
for i, char in enumerate(input_str):
    if char.isalpha():
        count = char_count.get(char, 0)
        if count > 0:
            next_char = chr(ord(char) + count)
            input_str = input_str[:i] + next_char + input_str[i+1:]
        char_count[char] = count + 1
print(input_str)
